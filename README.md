## 🚧 Current Projects

### [MASS Splitter 💵🔄](https://mass-splitter.vercel.app/)
A bill-splitting application currently being developed for my DIGT2107 software project. Our goal is to simplify the process of splitting bills among group members and tracking payments. This is being collaborated with:
- **Project Collaborators:** Sienna Markham, Mahjabin Mollah, and Steeve Nchanda.
- **Purpose:** To create an intuitive tool that makes bill-splitting easier for groups while allowing users to track payments.
- **Features:**
  - Users can create groups or manually add recipients to split bills.
  - Group leaders (Billers) can assign portions of the bill to each member, either evenly or by custom amounts.
  - Notifications are sent via email or SMS to inform users of their share and payment instructions.
  - Guest users can split bills without saving details, while logged-in users can save groups and track payment statuses.
- **Technologies Used:** React.js (frontend), Node.js (backend), SQL (database), and integrated notification services.
- **Goal:** To develop practical skills in full-stack development, focusing on user management, notifications, and payment tracking.

  
### SQLite App API Development
I am currently developing an API for a SQLite-based application. This project involves:
- **Designing an API interface** that allows users to interact seamlessly with the SQLite database.

This project aims to enhance my skills in backend development and API design, focusing on creating efficient, scalable, and secure web services.

### [MASS Encryptor 🚀🔐](https://mass-encryptor.vercel.app/)
A web application designed to engage users in cryptography by providing tools to encrypt and decrypt messages using common ciphers. This project involved:
- **Project Collaborators:** Worked with Sienna Markham, Mahjabin Mollah, and Steeve Nchanda.
- **Purpose:** An educational and fun tool suitable for users ranging from young children to adults, aiming to teach cryptography.
- **Features:**
  - Encoder and decoder for various ciphers like Caesar Cipher, Keyword Cipher, Atbash Cipher, and Morse Code.
  - Educational content on different ciphers and their uses.
  - Support for customizable themes and a responsive design.
  - Security measures including HTTPS and SSL/TLS certificates.
  - Future plans for video tutorials, additional ciphers, custom ciphers, gamification, AI integration, a blog portal, and a database for user feedback.
- **Technologies Used:** JavaScript for encoding/decoding algorithms, responsive design practices, and security protocols.
